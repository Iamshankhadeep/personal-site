# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal site's repo.

You can see it live here:

[``` sld.codes ```](https://sld.codes/)

I built the whole site using my favourite react framework - Gatsby! If you haven't heard of it, you should check it out here:

[``` Learn Gatsby ```](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)


## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [sld.codes](https://sld.codes). Thanks!

I want to keep this site open source however it's always disheartening to find that someone has copied my work without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing sld.codes, and I am proud of it! *All I ask of you is to not claim this effort as your own.*

I own the images used within the hero section of this site that are referenced in the code. Please do not use without my express permission.

If you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
