        Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex UI
        controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript-updated
        content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with
        such problems by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive
        technologies can recognize and use to let users know what is going on.
        Here well show how to use it at a basic level to improve accessibility.

            This article starts off the module with a good look at what
            accessibility is â€” this includes what groups of people we need to
            consider and why, what tools different people use to interact with
            the web, and how we can make accessibility part of our web
            development workflow.

            CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to
            allow for accessible web experiences, but if misused they can
            significantly harm accessibility. This article outlines some CSS and
            JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure that
            even complex content is as accessible as possible.
